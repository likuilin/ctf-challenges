*Who is GDB? was the only challenge in UIUCTF 2020 that did not get any write-ups.  
†Private internal CTF for [sigpwny](http://sigpwny.com/) that was long-running and generally had no write-ups.  
‡wasmcloud had zero solves by the end of the event, and was only first solved 18 hours after the event ended by the write-up author.
